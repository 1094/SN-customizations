These templates were made using [Gridzzly](https://gridzzly.com), and then edited to fit the SuperNote A6X, leaving room for the Tool bar on the left and the page bad on the top. Each template can be rotated or flipped to allow for your preffered bar placements.

Update
### 15 Oct 2022
I have cleaned up the right side edge of the Grid template; hopefully that will clear up the strange dots. I have also added two new templates: Grid Bottom and Dots Bottom. Both only have twenty rows of their repective style on the bottom of the page.I have also removed transparency from all the templates.

I wouldn't use a Lined Bottom template, which is why I didn't make one, but if you would, let me know.
