So, it turns out that two (2) templates can replace all of the templates in this repo for me. Using the kana template with no spaces, I made a dotted and grid template. 

But, while I'll only be using these two templates, I didn't wanna remove the others. 

Tech info: the dots have 25 pixels between them. the grid squares are 25 pixel wide.
